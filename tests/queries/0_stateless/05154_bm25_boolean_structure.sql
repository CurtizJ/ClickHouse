-- `bm25()` follows the boolean structure of the filter (Lucene / Elasticsearch `bool` semantics):
-- every matching scoring predicate adds its score, a conjunction adds the scores of its predicates
-- only when all of them hold, and predicates under NOT, non-text predicates and opaque functions add nothing.
